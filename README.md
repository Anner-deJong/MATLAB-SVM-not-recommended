# MATLAB SVM-not recommended

An old, simple, low level (unfinished?) implementation of the SVM algorithm with gradient descent. No kernels are included.
This code is NOT recommended for general, straightforward usage. Matlab comes with a much more efficient SVM implementation (not using gradient descent etc).

This code is useful for understanding the SVM algorithm, as well as a basis for creating your own specially designed (low-level) SVM.

**DISCLAIMER**: I believe there are implementation (<-> syntax) errors left, please take heed. <br>
